# ICP-based_CRUD_DApp
A basic ICP based DApp that performs Crud operations on user data


This is a CRUD-based Decentralized Application (DApp) built on the Internet Computer (ICP).
It performs Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on user data stored on-chain.

ðŸ§© Tech Stack
Backend: Rust + ic-cdk
Frontend: React.js
Interface Definition: Candid (.did file)
Communication Tooling: DFX SDK
Styling: SCSS (via index.scss)


#Backend Logic (Rust)
User data is stored in a HashMap<u64, User> structure using ic_cdk::storage.
Each user has a unique ID assigned automatically.
Exposed backend functions:
1. create_user(name, email) â†’ id
2. read_user(id) â†’ Option<User>
3. update_user(id, name, email) â†’ bool
4. delete_user(id) â†’ bool
5. list_users() â†’ Vec<User>
6. DID file is generated using candid::export_service!() in a test block.


ðŸš€ Commands Used
1. dfx new <project> â€“ Create a new DFX project.
2. dfx start â€“ Start the local Internet Computer replica.
3. dfx build â€“ Compile backend canisters (Rust to WASM).
4. dfx deploy â€“ Deploy canisters to the local network.
5. cargo test â€“ Run Rust tests (including export_service!() for DID).
6. npm install â€“ Install frontend dependencies.
7. npm run start â€“ Start the React frontend locally.
